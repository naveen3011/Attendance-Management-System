# Facial Recognition Engage2022
## Attendance-Management-System

**Problem Statement :** <br>
Face Recognition  *(To develop a browser-based application to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition technology).*

## Objective
Nowadays everyone wants that technology can help them to make them work easily. So , I made one  project which can help to take attendance so easily without any paperwork.

    Face Recognition
</p>


**Solution :** <br>
The purpose of this project is to take attendance using face detection. This program makes the CSV files of present attendees automatically After successful face detection. Also, It will make a CSV file for registered students‚Äô info.

**Domain :** <br>
AI/ML and Computer-Vision.<br>
*Face Recognition application is developed in python language using these libraries. OpenCV, Numpy, OS, Pandas, Tkinter.*

## How to run?
First of all, simply [download](https://github.com/naveen3011/Attendance-Management-System) this repo and install all the dependencies required for running this application from **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/naveen3011/Attendance-Management-System/blob/main/requirements.txt)**.

Open the terminal and run the following command *(Make sure you are connected to internet)*<br>K
`pip install -r /requirements.txt`

OR<br>
If you don't have required laibreries then firat you need to install that.

OpenCV
>pip install OpenCV-python

Numpy
>pip install numpy

Pandas
>pip install pandas

Os 
>pip install os

Tkinter 
>pip install tkinter

DateTime
>pip install DateTime

Now For run this project you need [haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml](https://github.com/naveen3011/Attendance-Management-System/blob/main/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) along with this [python file](https://github.com/naveen3011/Attendance-Management-System/blob/main/main.py) which contains the haar cascade features of a face.
Now you are good to go. 


Once all the dependencies are installed, now your system is ready to **run** this application ü•≥<br>
Just open [main.py](https://github.com/naveen3011/Attendance-Management-System/blob/main/main.py) on your IDE(VS Code) & **right-click** there and click on **'Run Python File in Terminal'** *as shown below...*
